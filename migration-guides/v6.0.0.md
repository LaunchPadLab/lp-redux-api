## v6.0.0 Migration Guide

This version contains the following breaking changes:
1. The middleware now requires an `adapter` to be initialized
2. `requestWithKey` and `setFromRequest` have been removed
3. `createStubRequest` has been renamed to `stubRequest`

### Adapter

The main breaking change in this version is that `middleware` now requires an **adapter** when it is initialized:

```js
applyMiddleware(
  middleware(adapter, options)
)
```

The adapter is a function that will be used to execute each request you make. It receives the options passed by your action creators and returns a promise.

Previous version(s) of this library used [lp-requests](https://github.com/LaunchPadLab/lp-requests) by default to make requests. To continue using this library, simply pass the `http` module as the adapter:

```js
// Important note: this requires lp-requests@>=4.

import { http } from 'lp-requests'

const defaultOptions = { ... }

applyMiddleware(
  middleware(http, defaultOptions)
)

```

However, you are also free to use any adapter you like, as long as it fits the defined interface:

```js
import axios from 'axios'

const defaultOptions = { ... }

applyMiddleware(
  middleware(axios, defaultOptions)
)
```

### Removed functions

The following deprecated functions have been removed from this library:
* `requestWithKey`
* `setFromRequest`

You can replace these function with the following functions respectively:
* `createRequest`
* `setOnSuccess`

Here's an example of this replacement:

```diff

// apiActions.js

- const REQ_USER = 'REQ_USER'

- function fetchUser (id) {
-   return requestWithKey(REQ_USER, {
-     url: '/users/' + id,
-   })
- }

+ const fetchUser = createRequest('FETCH_USER', (id) => ({
+   url: '/users/' + id,
+ }))

// reducer.js

const reducer = handleActions({
-   ...setFromRequest(apiActions.REQ_USER, 'user'),
+   [apiActions.fetchUser]: setOnSuccess('user')
})

...

const selectors = {
-  user: select('user.success'),
+  user: select('user'),
}
```
