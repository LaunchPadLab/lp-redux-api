## v5.0.0 Migration Guide

There are three breaking changes in this version:

1. `selectStatus()` has been removed and replaced by `selectors.status()`
1. `onResponse` has been migrated to `waitForResponse` in `lp-utils v2.16.0`
1. `isAuthenticated()`, `isAuthenticatedWithContext()` and `getAuthenticationContext()` have been migrated to `lp-requests v2.4.0`

When replacing `selectStatus()` with `selectors.status()`, keep in mind that the order of the first two arguments has been switched:
- `selectStatus(requestKey, state, [slice])`
- `selectors.status(state, requestKey, [slice])`
