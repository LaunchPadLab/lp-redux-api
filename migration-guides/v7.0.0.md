# v7.0.0 Migration Guide

## Breaking changes
This library no longer supports Internet Explorer (IE). Previous iterations had a polyfill for the [Symbol](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Symbol) primitive, which is fully supported by all major browsers.

If you have an older project that needs to support IE, avoid this version or bring in your own Symbol polyfill.
